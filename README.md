## I'm Jonas Ramos!

Hey buddy, welcome to my profile.

Introducing myself, I've started programming when I was 13yo at school. On 2016 I decided to start a degree in Computer Science, that I've done in 2020.

Before to finish the degree, I've started a position as a Data Analyst, working specifically with the Qlik Products.

In parallels, I was learning other technologies and improving my web development skills.

So, today my mainly skills are Data Analysis, focused on Qlik (and a little bit of Power BI), front end development using ReactJS.

And... The technologies that I'm currently studying are NodeJS and React Native.

That's a little bit about myself and... let's learn together.
